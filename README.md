Hello,

This is an example of a cron microservices within serverless archichitecture.

The purpose of these microservices is to Extract, Transform and Load data from AWS dynamoDB to S3 with following usage in Microsoft Dynamics. Also powerBI does the same thing as above, but later data is loaded via AWS Data Pipeline into MySQL database.

I have also developed bigger microservices within node/express as a stand alone services for collecting and storing reporting data from various services into Reporting Server, where the data stored in ElasticSearch.

Kind regards,
Max
